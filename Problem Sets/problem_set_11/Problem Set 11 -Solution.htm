<h1>Problem Set 11 - Solution</h1>
<h2>Graphs: Representation, Traversal</h2>
</center>

<li>
<p>Suppose a weighted undirected graph has <em>n</em> vertices and
<em>e</em> edges. The weights are all integers. Assume that the space
needed to store an integer is the same as the space needed to store
an object reference, both equal to one unit. <em>What is the minimum
value of e</em> for which the adjacency matrix representation would 
require less space than the adjacency linked lists representation?
Ignore the space needed to store vertex labels.

</p><p>
<b>SOLUTION</b>

</p><p>Space for adjacency matrix (AMAT) is <em>n^2</em>.
Space for adjacency linked lists (ALL) is <em>n + 3*2e = n + 6e</em>.
(Each node needs 3 units of space: 1 for the neighbor number, 1 for the edge
weight, and 1 for the next node reference. And there are 2<em>e</em> nodes.)
The space required by AMAT and ALL is the same when <em>n^2 = n + 6e</em>,
i.e. when <em>e = (n^2 - n)/6</em>. 

</p><p>The minimum
value of <em>e</em> for which the adjacency matrix representation would 
require less space than the adjacency linked lists representation is
one more than the <em>e</em> above, which would be 
<em>(n^2 - n)/6+1</em>. 
</p><hr>
</li><li> The complement of an <b>undirected</b> graph, <b>G</b>, is a graph 
<b>GC</b> such that:
<ul>
<li> <b>GC</b> has the same set of vertices as <b>G</b>
</li><li> For every edge <em>(i,j)</em> in <b>G</b>, there is no edge
<em>(i,j)</em> in <b>GC</b>
</li><li> For every pair of vertices <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> in <b>G</b>
for which there is no edge <em>(p,q)</em>, there is an edge <em>(p,q)</em> in 
<b>GC</b>.
</li></ul><p>
Implement a method that would return the complement
of the <b>undirected</b> graph on which this method is applied. 
</p><pre>    class Edge {
       int vnum;
       Edge next;
    }

    public class Graph {
       Edge[] adjlists;  // adjacency linked lists
       ...
       public Graph complement() {
          // FILL IN THIS METHOD
          ...
       }
    }
</pre>

What would be the worst case running time (big O) of an implementation for a
graph with <em>n</em> vertices and <em>e</em> edges?
<p>
<b>SOLUTION</b>
</p><pre>   public Graph complement() {
      boolean[][] temp = new boolean[adjlists.length][adjlists.length];
      // in temp, fill in trues for the edges
      for (int v=0;v &lt; adjlists.length;v++) {
         for (Edge e=adjlists[v];e != null;e = e.next) {
            temp[v][e.vnum] = true;
         }
      }
      // complement temp
      for (int i=0; i &lt; adjlists.length; i++) {
          for (int j=0; j &lt; adjlists.length; j++) {
              if (i != j) { // leave out the diagonal
                 temp[i][j] = !temp[i][j];
              }
          }
      }
      // now create the adjacency linked lists for the complement graph
      Edge[] compall = new Edge[adjlists.length];
      for (int v=0;v &lt; compall.length;v++) {
         for (int j=0; j &lt; adjlists.length; j++) { 
            if (temp[v][j]) {
               Edge e = new Edge();
               e.vnum = j; 
               e.next = compall[v];
               compall[v] = e;
            }
         }
      }
      // create new Graph and return
      Graph comp = new Graph();
      comp.adjlists = compall;
      return comp;
   }

</pre>
Running time is <em>O(n^2)</em> - this is the time needed to compute the complement
matrix. (A more abstract way of reasoning about this is to note that the
original graph and its complement would involve all possible edges between the <em>n</em>
vertices, which is O(n^2).)

<font color="red"><b>WORK OUT THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM AND TURN IT IN AT RECITATION
</b></font>

<p>Consider this graph:
</p><p style="margin-left:100px;"><img src="Problem%20Set%2011%20-Solution_files/forkjoin.png">

</p><p>This graph has <em>n+2</em> vertices and 2<em>n</em> edges. For
every vertex labeled <em>i</em>, <em>1 &lt;= i &lt;= n</em>, there is an
edge from <em>S</em> to <em>i</em>, and an edge from <em>i</em> to

<em>T</em>.

</p><ol>
<li>How many different depth-first search sequences are possible if the
start vertex is <em>S</em>? 
</li><li>How many different breadth-first search sequences are possible if the
start vertex is <em>S</em>? 
</li></ol>
<p><b>SOLUTION</b>
</p><ol>
<li><em>n!</em>, for the different permutations of the vertices <tt>1</tt>

through <tt>n</tt>. (Note: If a vertex <tt>v</tt> in this set is visited immediately
after <tt>S</tt>, then <tt>T</tt> would be immediately visited after <tt>v</tt>.)

<p>For instance, say <em>n = 3</em>. Here are all possible DFS sequences 
(3! = 6):
</p><pre>
     S 1 T 2 3
     S 1 T 3 2
     S 2 T 1 3
     S 2 T 3 1
     S 3 T 1 2
     S 3 T 2 1
</pre>
</li><li><em>n!</em>, similar to DFS. The only difference is that <tt>T</tt> will be
the last vertex to be visited. So, if <em>n = 3</em>, the possible BFS sequences 
are:
<pre>     S 1 2 3 T
     S 1 3 2 T
     S 2 1 3 T
     S 2 3 1 T
     S 3 1 2 T
     S 3 2 1 T
</pre>
</li></ol>
<hr>
</li><li>
<p><span class="star">*</span> You can use DFS to check if there is a path from one vertex to another
in a directed graph. 

</p><p>Implement the method <b>hasPath</b> in the following. Use additional
class fields/helper methods as needed:


</p><pre>   public class Neighbor {
      public int vertex;
      public Neighbor next;
      ...
   }

   public class Graph {
      Neighbor[] adjLists;  // adjacency linked lists for all vertices

      // returns true if there is a path from v to w, false otherwise
      public boolean hasPath(int v, int w) {
        // FILL IN THIS METHOD
        ...
      }
   }
</pre>
<p><b>SOLUTION</b>
</p><pre>      public boolean hasPath(int v, int w) {
         if (v == w) return false;
         int n = adjlists.length;
         boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
         for (int i=0; i &lt; n; i++) {
             visited[i] = false;
         }
         return pathDFS(v,w,visited);
      }

      private boolean pathDFS(int current, int w, boolean[] visited) {
         if (current == w) return true;
         visited[current] = true;
         for (Neighbor ptr=adjlists[current]; ptr != null; ptr=ptr.next) {
             if (!visited[ptr.vertex]) {
                if (pathDFS(ptr.vertex, w, visited)) {
                   return true;
                }
             }
         }
         return false;
      }
